# AI-Based-Diabetes-prediction-system

Diabetes is a chronic disease and one of the deadliest diseases and a major public health challenge worldwide. It is caused by a deficiency of insulin produced by the pancreas. Many complications arise if diabetes goes untreated and unknown. The tedious identification process results in the patient visiting a diagnostic center and seeing a doctor. the development of artificial intelligence techniques solves this critical problem. The motivation for this application is to design an artificial intelligence model that could predict the probability of developing diabetes in patients with the highest accuracy.
